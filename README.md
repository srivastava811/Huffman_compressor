# Huffman_compressor
This project showcases compression of file using Huffman compression using JAVA.

### Definition of Huffman Compressor
- Huffman Algorithm is a greedy algorithm.
- This algorithm assigns variable binary codes for each input character in the text file.
- The length of binary code depends upon the frequency of a character in the file.
- The algorithm creates a binary tree structure that stores the unique characters in the leaf nodes of the tree.
